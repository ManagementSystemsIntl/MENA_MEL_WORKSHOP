### Welcome!

-   Who we are
-   What we do
-   How we hope to help you

### Objectives of workshop sessions

-   Introduce advanced-level content around Monitoring, Evaluation, and Learning (MEL)
-   Review current trends in data analytics, causal inference, machine learning, and Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)


### Benchmarks for success

By the end of this session, participants will be able to:

-   Understand USAID practice around causal modeling

-   Introduce new analytical developments that can extend USAID practice of causal modeling and link it to impact evaluation and learning agendas

-  Identify management opportunities to incorporate best practice and new trends into activity implementation


### Benchmarks for success

How does USAID do causal modeling?

### Logic model

-  A graphic or visual depiction of a theory of change that illustrates the connection between what a strategy, project, or activity will do and what it hopes to achieve

-  There are a wide range of logic models
  -  Results Framework
  -  LogFrame
  -  Causal loop diagram
  
### LogFrame

- Complements the CDCS Results Framework by carrying the development hypothesis through from the overall program/project to the supporting activities
- LogFrame replicates the causal linkages, but starting from a Development Objective and ending with activity inputs
- While the Results Framework is a strategic planning tool, an activity's Logical Framework defines exactly what resources are needed to achieve results

### Results Framework

- A type of logic model representing the development hypothesis of a USAID mission's strategy
- Diagrams the causal links between the strategy's Goal, Development Objectives (DOs), and Intermediate Results (IRs)

### Causal loop diagram

- Identifies the primary variables of a complex system and visualizes their relationships

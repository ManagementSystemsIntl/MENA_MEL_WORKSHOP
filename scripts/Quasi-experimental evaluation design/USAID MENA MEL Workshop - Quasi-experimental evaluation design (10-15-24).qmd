### Objectives of impact evaluation sessions

-   Understand the need for impact estimation of USAID activities
-   Understand how impact estimation fits into the Agency performance management framework
-   Gain practical knowledge about impact evaluation to help USAID staff better manage and support IEs

### Benchmarks for success

By the end of this session, participants will be able to:

-   Understand selection bias as a fundamental difficulty in identifying a valid counterfactual

-   Identify strategies for generating 'as-if' randomization

-   Understand the relative strengths and weaknesses of different designs

### [Level Set]{style="color:white;"} {background-color="#002F6C"}

### Measuring social benefit

We want to know the causal effect of an activity on its beneficiaries

-   Job training on earnings and employment

-   Teacher qualifications on student outcomes

-   Humanitarian assistance on food security

### Identifying a treatment assignment

-   We established indicators for treatment assignment $D_i$ and an outcome of interest $Y_i$

-   We established the switching equation $Y_i=D_iY_i^1+(1-D_i)Y_i^0$ mapping a potential treatment assignment to a realized outcome

-   We re-wrote the switching equation to $Y_i=Y_i^0+(Y_i^1-Y_i^0)D_i$ in order to highlight the individual treatment effect term $\delta_i=Y_i^1-Y_i^0$

### Decomposing the difference in means

We decomposed the difference in means into the average treatment effect and selection bias

$E\bigr[Y^1|D=1\bigr]-E\bigr[Y^0|D=0\bigr]$\
Average Treatment Effect on the Treated (ATT)\   
<center>+</center>  
$E\bigr[Y^0|D=1\bigr]-E\bigr[Y^0|D=0\bigr]$\
Difference between treatment and control group, before treatment (Selection bias)

### Dealing with selection bias 

- We established that the intervention could not be randomly assigned

- Without randomization, we don't have assurance that the selection bias term is zero! 

- What else could we do to make the selection bias term zero ? 

### Approximating as-if randomization

-   Adjust for confounders (regression adjustment / statistical matching)

-   Use trends over time to remove bias (difference-in-differences, interrupted time series)

-   Utilize an intervention's scoring system (regression discontinuity)

-   Use features of the natural world (instrumental variables)

### Adjusting for confounders

- Let's say we knew that we have non-random assignment of treatment, but we know EXACTLY what determines treatment (variables A, B, C)

- If we match on / control for variables A, B, C then we would achieve independence between the assignment of treatment and the outcome

- This is called unconfoundedness

$D\perp Y |A, B, C$

### Adjusting for confounders

- What if we DID NOT know what determined the non-random assignment of treatment?

- We have observed variables we believe are related to treatment

- We have unobserved variables related to treatment

### Selection on observables

- We can adjust for observed variables that help determine treatment
- We could theorize about the variables affecting treatment that are unobserved
- We can't do anything about variables affecting treatment that we don't know about

### Selection on observables

- This highlights the fundamental weakness of adjusting for confounders
- We can control for what we know about and have observed, but there may be other variables we haven't observed
- Regression adjustment / matching is often not a convincing strategy for causal inference

### Using trends over time (d-i-d)

- If we have a d-i-d setup with randomization, we can use the trend in the control group to estimate the counterfactual for the treatment group

- This only works if we know the pre-treatment trends would have been the same in the treatment and control groups!

- This is called the parallel trends assumption

### Parallel trends assumption

- The researcher MUST demonstrate parallel trends, or provide a compelling case for why they believe this assumption holds

```{r}
include_graphics("Baker three timings replication.png")

```


### Using trends over time

-   Recall that the fundamental problem of causal inference states that we can't go back in time, and we don't have access to alternate universes

- What if, instead of going back in time, we looked into the past? 

- The interrupted time series (ITS) design becomes possible when you have at least three data points before treatment and three data points after treatment (more is better)

### Interrupted times series 

- Interrupted times series allows a within-comparison (itself) and avoids a between-comparison (something else)

```{r}
include_graphics("interrupted time series no title.png")

```
### Interrupted Time Series

- Interrupted time series is especially applicable when you have abundant data but entire systems or populations are treated, such that no comparison group is possible

- Because ITS looks at a longer historical period, there may be other historical trends affecting your data

- The historical trend could be within your own treated units (maturation)

### Using an intervention's scoring system

- Recall that regression adjustment / matching balances observed characteristics across treatment and control groups

- In contrast, what if there were a variable that completely divided treatment from the controls around an arbitrary cut-off?

- This is the regression discontinuity (RD) design

### Regression Discontinuity

- The most common application of the RD design is when there is a score to determine treatment

```{r}
include_graphics("RD graphic 2 crop.png")

```
### Real-world RD

RD applies in any situation where there is a running (score) variable with an arbitrary cutoff that creates 'as-if' randomization

```{r}
include_graphics("all deaths by age.png")

```



### RD strengths and limitations

For a valid RD design: 

- The cutoff score must be arbitrary

- The score must COMPLETELY determine treatment

- The score cannot be manipulated 

### Using features of the natural world

- What if we could find some real-world process that behaved randomly with respect to what you are studying? 

- We could look at how our outcome responds to treatment, where treatment is ONLY applied based on the real-world random process

- This is instrumental variable estimation

### Watch your instruments 

- The instrument must affect your outcome ONLY through its effect on treatment (exclusion restriction)

- Is rainfall a random process with regard to development interventions? 
  - In many cases, possibly yes
  
- But rainfall has now been used as an instrument to generate treatment effect estimates across hundreds of studies

### Violating the exclusion restriction 

- 294 studies using rainfall instrument, 194 possible exclusion restrictions!

### Ramadan, economic activity, and happiness

Surah Al-Baqarah (2:183-185):

"O you who have believed, decreed upon you is fasting as it was decreed upon those before you that you may become righteous -" 

"So whoever sights the new moon of the month, let him fast it"

### Is the lunar calendar a valid instrument?

- The lunar calendar moves Ramadan 11 days per year

- This also affects the number of hours of fasting per day

- Cross-reference fasting hours per day with economic activity or subjective well-being

- Exclusion restriction: Does the moon also affect economic activity or subjective well-being?

### Review

- We have reviewed evaluation designs that seek to generate 'as-if' randomization

- This 'as-if' randomization must eliminate selection bias

$D\perp Y$

$D\perp Y |\text{as-if randomization}$

### What are the strengths and limitations? 

- Regression adjustment / matching

- Difference-in-differences

- Interrupted time series

- Regression discontinuity

- Instrumental variables

### Quasi-experimental evaluation designs

- Researchers must fully engage with the limitations of their design, and address how they removed or mitigated threats to validity

- Stay tuned for a deeper dive on matching, and a case study on the use of advanced d-i-d methods in a real-world evaluation

### Session Objectives

By the end of this session, participants will be able to:

- Understand the conditions in which indirect measurement is appropriate

- Understand different ways of applying indirect measurement methods

- Understand the strengths and limitations of each method

- Understand more general methods of survey experimentation

[Empirical Validation Study of Popular Survey Methodologies for Sensitive Questions](https://imai.fas.harvard.edu/research/files/validate.pdf)


### Respondents Hide Their Feelings or Behavior

- Support for violent actors or actions
- Having an unpopular/stigmatized opinion
- Victimization
- Health condition
- Criminal or stigmatized behavior

### Can We Measure What Respondents Hide?

- Randomized response
- List
- Endorsements

These tactics are part of a broader approach of survey experimentation

### Randomized Response

- Introduce a randomizing device (die, coin)
- Respondent applies randomizing device in private, without enumerator observation
- Respondent produces a set response or answers truthfully, based on result of randomizing device

### Randomized Response Example

"For this question, I want you to answer yes or no after the result of a coin flip. If the coin lands on Heads, please respond Yes. If the coin lands on Tails, please respond truthfully to the question. [TURN AWAY FROM RESPONDENT]"

```{r}
set.seed(332)
n <- 1e3
dot <- data.frame(flip = rbinom(n, 1, .5)) %>%
  mutate(result=ifelse(flip==1, "Heads", "Tails"),
         action=ifelse(result=="Heads", "Answer Yes", "Answer truthfully"),
         result_heads=ifelse(result=="Heads", 1, # answer Yes if heads
                         NA),
         result_tails=rbinom(n, 1, .3),
         observed=ifelse(result=="Heads", result_heads, result_tails))
#head(dot) %>%
#  gt()
```

```{r}
tbl <- data.frame(Measure=c("Observed", "Truth"),
                  Proportion=c("64%", "29%"))
tbl_gt <- tbl %>%
  gt()
#tbl_gt
```

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="60%"}
```{r}
head(dot) %>%
  gt() %>%
  opt_table_font(font="Gill Sans Mt",
                 size=20) %>%
  cols_align(align="center") 

```

:::

::: {.column width="40%"}
```{r}

tbl %>%
  gt() %>%
  opt_table_font(font="Gill Sans Mt",
                 size=20) %>%
  cols_align(align="center") 
```

### Quick Review

Recall how we estimate the mean of a sample: 

For data points [6, 10], the unweighted mean is $\frac{6+10}{2}$ = 8

This is equivalent to equal weights: $(6*.5) + (10*.5) = 3+5 = 8$

For data points [6, 10] with weights [.75, .25], the mean is $(6*.75)+(10*.25) = 4.5+2.5=7$

### So How Do We Recover Truth?

$P(Observed) = \Bigl(P(Heads)\times 1\Bigr) + \Bigl(P(Tails)\times P(Truth)\Bigr)$

Solve for the unknown: 

$P(Truth) = \frac{P(Observed) - P(Heads)}{P(Tails)}$

$\frac{.64 - .5}{.5} = .28$      ...recall that our true value was 29%

We recovered truth, to within a small bit of sampling error

### List Experiments

- Show a list to the respondent
- Ask respondent to provide a count of the list items they agree with or support
- Randomize the list ordering
- Randomize the assignment of a treatment of an additional sensitive item 

### Measuring Support for Foreign Forces

"I’m going to read you a list with the names of different groups and individuals on it. After I read the entire list, I’d like you to tell me *how many* of these groups and individuals you broadly support, meaning that you generally agree with the goals and policies of the group or individual."

```{r}
# ot <- data.frame(Control=c("Karzai Government", "National Solidarity Program", "Local Farmers", ""),
#                  Treatment=c("Karzai Government", "National Solidarity Program", "Local Farmers", "International Security Assistance Forces (ISAF)"))
# 
# ot %>% 
#   gt() %>%
#   opt_table_font(font="Gill Sans Mt",
#                  size=16) %>%
#   cols_align(align="center")


```

### Measuring Support for Foreign Forces

| Control | Treatment |
|---------|-----------|
| Karzai Government | Karzai Government |
| National Solidarity Program | National Solidarity Program |
| Local Farmers | Local Farmers |
|                | International Security Assistance Forces (ISAF) |

### Analyzing List Experiments

Illustrative data only! 

```{r}
include_graphics("list raw count mn.png")

```


### Endorsement of Extremist Actor

Measuring support for Taliban in conflict zones

| Condition | Statement |
|-----------|-----------|
| Control   | It has recently been proposed to allow Afghans to vote in direct elections when selecting leaders for district councils. How strongly would you support this policy?  |
| Actor A   | It has recently been proposed by foreign forces... |
| Actor B   | It has recently been proposed by Taliban... |

: {tbl-colwidths="[15,85]"}

### Influence of Actor on Religious Practice

| Condition | Statement |
|-----------|-----------|
| Control   | Muslim women should have the right to decide whether to wear the veil [agree/disagree] |
| Treatment | [Violent actor] believes that Muslim women must demonstrate modesty by wearing a veil. Others say that women should have the right to decide. Which opinion do you agree with? |

: {tbl-colwidths="[10,90]"}

### Support for Taliban

Illustrative data only! 

```{r}

```

### Survey Experimentation

- Encouragement design
  - Randomize the offer of treatment

- Information treatment
  - Randomize the provision of information

### Information Treatment

"In the last year, USAID has provided $X in assistance for the social development for the people of [Country]"

```{r}
include_graphics("USAID information treatments meta-analysis estimates (10-18-24).png")
```

### What Have We Learned 

| Method  | Measure |
|---|---|
| Randomized response | Interaction with militants in Nigeria |
| List or <br>Endorsements | - Support for violence/violent actors<br>- Extremist influence on religious practice |
| Encouragement | Testing new financial products for microenterprises |
| Information | Value of USAID branding |

### Recap

- This session has introduced the concept of indirect measurement

- Indirect measurement is part of a broader approach of survey experimentation

- Any new intervention or M&E activity should consider where these approaches may add value

- Stay tuned for sessions on causal modeling and learning agendas

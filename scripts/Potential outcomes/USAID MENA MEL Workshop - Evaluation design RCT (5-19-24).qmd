### Welcome!

-   Who we are
-   What we do
-   How we hope to help you

### Objectives of impact evaluation sessions

-   Understand the need for impact estimation of USAID activities
-   Understand how impact estimation fits into the Agency performance management framework
-   Gain practical knowledge about impact evaluation to help USAID staff better manage and support IEs

### Benchmarks for success

By the end of this session, participants will be able to:

-   Understand selection bias as a fundemantal difficulty in identifying a valid counterfactual

-   Identify randomization as the most effective means of identifying the counterfactual

-   Understand the key validity threats to Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs) 

-   Identify the key points in the RCT management cycle to identify and mitigate these threats

### Benchmarks for success

*Bonus content:*

-   Randomization vs. Optimization

-   Longitudinal data

### Measuring social benefit

We want to know the causal effect of an activity on its beneficiaries

-   Job training on earnings and employment

-   Teacher qualifications on student outcomes

-   Humanitarian assistance on food security

### Identifying a treatment assignment

- We established indicators for treatment assignment *D* and an outcome of interest *Y*

- We established a switching equation mapping a potential treatment assignment to a realized outcome

- We stressed a distinction between treatment *assignment* and the treatment assignment *mechanism*

### The treatment assignment mechanism

- Why is this distinction so important? 

- Because many activities we evaluate target specific sub-samples of a broader population
  - The poor
  - The marginalized
  - The conflict-affected
  
- We can't just compare these participants to a randomly selected member of the population!

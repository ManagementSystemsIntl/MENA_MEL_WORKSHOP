### Objectives of Impact Evaluation Sessions

-   Understand the need for impact estimation of USAID activities
-   Understand how impact estimation fits into the Agency performance management framework
-   Gain practical knowledge about impact evaluation to help USAID staff better manage and support IEs

### Benchmarks for Success

By the end of this session, participants will be able to:

-   Explain the fundamental problem of causal inference

-   Explain how impact estimation can be seen as a problem of missing data

-   Relive unpleasant schoolhood memories of having to learn algebra

### Benchmarks for Success

*Bonus content:*

-   Is causal inference a two-body or three-body problem?

-   How has causal inference developed out of traditions from MENA region?

### [The Fundamental Problem]{style="color:white;"} {background-color="#002F6C"}

### Measuring Social Benefit

We want to know the causal effect of an activity on its beneficiaries

-   Job training on earnings and employment

-   Teacher qualifications on student outcomes

-   Humanitarian assistance on food security

### Identifying a Treatment assignment

-   Consider an indicator for a *potential* beneficiary, $D_i$

-   $D$ tells us whether there is an activity, or a "treatment"

-   The subscript $i$ denotes a single individual who is either treated or not treated

    -   $D_i$ = 1 means participation in an activity

    -   $D_i$ = 0 means no participation in an activity

### Identifying an Outcome

Now consider an indicator for the outcome of a potential beneficiary, $Y_i$, where $i$ denotes each person or unit under study.

-   $Y_i^1$ is the outcome after activity participation ($D_i=1$)

-   $Y_i^0$ is the outcome without the activity ($D_i=0$)

-   Note that $Y^1$ and $Y^0$ denote *possibilities* for the *same unit*, unit *i*

### From Potential to Realized Outcomes

We use what is called a 'switching equation' to assign treatment and move from a potential to a realized outcome

-   $Y_i=D_iY_i^1+(1-D_i)Y_i^0$

(Plug in $D_i=1$ and $D_i=0$ and see what you end up with)

### Treated Outcome

$Y_i=D_iY_i^1+(1-D_i)Y_i^0$ where $D_i=1$

-   $Y_i=1*Y_i^1+1*Y_i^0-1*Y_i^0$

-   $Y_i=Y_i^1+Y_i^0-Y_i^0$

-   $Y_i=Y_i^1$

![](alg-alert_v1.png){.absolute bottom="80" right="55" width=200}

### Untreated Outcome

$Y_i=D_iY_i^1+(1-D_i)Y_i^0$ where $D_i=0$

-   $Y_i=0*Y_i^1+1*Y_i^0-0*Y_i^0$

-   $Y_i=0+Y_i^0-0$

-   $Y_i=Y_i^0$

![](alg-alert_v1.png){.absolute bottom="80" right="55" width=200}

### Difference Between Assignment and Mechanism

-   The switching equation determines where (to whom) treatment is assigned

-   We call this the treatment assignment

-   The switching equation does **NOT** address **HOW** treatment is assigned

-   We call this the treatment assignment *mechanism*

### From Assignment to Treatment Effect

We can also write the switching equation this way:

-   $Y_i=Y_i^0+(Y_i^1-Y_i^0)D_i$

-   Notice our treatment effect $Y_i^1-Y_i^0$, or the difference between the treated and untreated outcome

-   We call the difference $Y_i^1-Y_i^0$ $delta$, or $\delta_i$

-   Remember that the treatment effect $\delta_i$ refers to a *single* unit or person!

### Recap

-   The effect of the activity (treatment effect) on unit $i$ is the difference between the two potential outcomes

-   $Y_i^1 - Y_i^0$ is the difference in outcomes for the *same unit or person*

-   A person participates in an activity, and then goes back in time and does not participate in the activity

-   Or, a person participates in an activity, and then we check an alternate universe where she did not participate in the activity

### You Ask the Impossible

```{r fig.align="right", fig.height=2, fig.width=3}

#include_graphics("luke impossible.jpg")

```

-   But how can one person be both treated and untreated?

-   In the real world, person $i$ experiences one of the potential outcomes, but not both

-   If $D_i=1$, the potential outcome of $Y_i$ becomes $Y_i^1$ in fact and the outcome of $Y_i^0$ is unknowable

-   If $D_i=0$, the potential outcome of $Y_i$ becomes $Y_i^0$ in fact and the outcome of $Y_i^1$ is unknowable

### The Fundamental Problem of Causal Inference

-   This is the fundamental problem of causal inference

-   We observe only one outcome, but we need both outcomes to describe the effect of the activity

-   We refer to the outcome that didn't happen as the *counterfactual*, or what would have happened in the absence of the activity

### Something is Missing

| Group     | $Y_i^1$        | $Y_i^0$        |
|-----------|----------------|----------------|
| Treatment | Observed       | Counterfactual |
| Control   | Counterfactual | Observed       |

```{r}
Group <- c("Treatment","Control")
Yi1 <- c("Observed", "Counterfactual")
Yi0 <- c("Counterfactual","Observed")

t1 <- cbind(Group, Yi1, Yi0) %>%
  as.data.frame() 

# t1 %>%
#   gt() %>%
#   opt_table_font(font="Gill Sans Mt",
#                  size=16) %>%
#   cols_align(align="center") 

```

-   Researchers sometimes refer to impact evaluation as a "missing data problem"

-   We are missing two pieces of information about what happens with or without the treatment

### What Do We Do Now?

-   How do we estimate the effect of a activity, if we cannot observe both potential outcomes?

-   We can't go back in time, and we don't have access to alternate universes

-   We must compare what was treated with something that was not treated

-   But, what are the differences between the two? How might these differences obscure the true effect of the activity? 

### Cliffhanger

Tune into the next session for a resolution of the Fundamental Problem of Causal Inference!

-   Experimental impact evaluation
-   Quasi-experimental impact evaluation

### Bonus Content

-   Causal inference as a two-body or a three-body problem
-   Causal inference from traditions in Middle East and North Africa

### [The Three-Body Problem]{style="color:white;"} {background-color="#002F6C"}

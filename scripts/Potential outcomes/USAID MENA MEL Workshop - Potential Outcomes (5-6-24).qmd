### Welcome!

-   Who we are
-   What we do
-   How we hope to help you

### Objectives of impact evaluation sessions

-   Understand the need for impact estimation of USAID activities
-   Understand how impact estimation fits into the Agency performance management framework
-   Gain practical knowledge about impact evaluation to help USAID staff better manage and support IEs


### Benchmarks for success

By the end of this session, participants will be able to:

-   Explain the fundamental problem of causal inference

-   Explain how impact estimation can be seen as a problem of missing data

-   Relive unpleasant schoolhood memories of having to learn algebra

### Benchmarks for success

*Bonus content:*

-   Is causal inference a two-body or three-body problem?

-   How has causal inference developed out of traditions from MENA region?

### [The Fundamental Problem]{style="color:white;"} {background-color="#002F6C"} 

### Measuring social benefit

We want to know the causal effect of an activity on its beneficiaries

-   Job training on earnings and employment

-   Teacher qualifications on student outcomes

-   Humanitarian assistance on food security

### Identifying a treatment assignment

- Consider an indicator for a *potential* beneficiary, $D_i$

- $D$ tells us whether there is an activity, or a "treatment"

- The subscript $i$ denotes a single individual who is either treated or not treated

    - $D_i$ = 1 means participation in an activity

    - $D_i$ = 0 means no participation in an activity
 

### Identifying an outcome

Now consider an indicator for the outcome of a potential beneficiary, $Y_i$, where $i$ denotes each person or unit under study.

- $Y_i^1$ is the outcome after activity participation ($D_i=1$)

- $Y_i^0$ is the outcome without the activity ($D_i=0$)

- Note that $Y_1$ and $Y_0$ denote *possibilities* for the *same unit*, unit *i*!

### Switching across treated and untreated outcomes

We use what is called a 'switching equation' to connect a treatment assignment to a realized outcome

- $Y_i=D_iY_i^1+(1-D_i)Y_i^0$

(Plug in $D_i=1$ and $D_i=0$ and see what you end up with)

### ALGEBRA ALERT

$Y_i=D_iY_i^1+(1-D_i)Y_i^0$ where $D_i=1$

-   $Y_i=1*Y_i^1+1*Y_i^0-1*Y_i^0$

-   $Y_i=Y_i^1+Y_i^0-Y_i^0$

-   $Y_i=Y_i^1$

### ALGEBRA ALERT

$Y_i=D_iY_i^1+(1-D_i)Y_i^0$ where $D_i=0$

-   $Y_i=0*Y_i^1+1*Y_i^0-0*Y_i^0$

-   $Y_i=0+Y_i^0-0$

-   $Y_i=Y_i^0$

### Difference between assignment and mechanism

- The switching equation determines where (to whom) treatment is assigned

- We call this the treatment assignment

- The switching equation does **NOT** address **HOW** treatment is assigned

- We call this the treatment assignment *mechanism*

### From assignment to treatment effect

We can also write the switching equation this way:

- $Y_i=Y_i^0+(Y_i^1-Y_i^0)D_i$

- Notice our treatment effect $Y_i^1-Y_i^0$, or the difference between the treated and untreated outcome

- We call the difference $Y_i^1-Y_i^0$ $delta$, or $\delta_i$

- Remember that the treatment effect $\delta_i$ refers to a *single* unit or person!

### Recap:

- The effect of the activity (treatment effect) on unit $i$ is the difference between the two potential outcomes

- Treatment effect = $Y_i^1 - Y_i^0$, or $\delta_i$

- This is the difference in potential outcomes for the *same unit or person*

- A person participates in an activity, and then goes back in time and does not participate in the activity

### You ask the impossible

```{r fig.align="right", fig.height=2, fig.width=3}

#include_graphics("luke impossible.jpg")

```

- But how can one person be both treated and untreated?

- In the real world, person $i$ experiences one of the potential outcomes, but not both

- If $D_i=1$, the potential outcome of $Y_i$ becomes $Y_i^1$ in fact and the potential outcome of $Y_i^0$ is unobserved

- If $D_i=0$, the potential outcome of $Y_i$ becomes $Y_i^0$ in fact and the potential outcome of $Y_i^1$ is unobserved

### The fundamental problem of causal inference

- This is the fundamental problem of causal inference

- We observe only one outcome, but we need both outcomes to describe the effect of the activity

- We refer to the outcome that didn't happen as the *counterfactual*, or what would have happened in the absence of the activity

### [The Missing Data Problem]{style="color:white;"} {background-color="#002F6C"} 

### Something is missing

```{r}
Group <- c("Treatment","Control")
Yi1 <- c("Observed", "Counterfactual")
Yi0 <- c("Counterfactual","Observed")

t1 <- cbind(Group, Yi1, Yi0) %>%
  as.data.frame()

flextable(t1)
```

- Researchers sometimes refer to impact evaluation as a "missing data problem"

- We are missing two pieces of information about what happens with or without the treatment

### What do we do now?

- How do we estimate the effect of a activity, if we cannot observe the same person go through both potential outcomes?

- We must compare a person who was treated with a person who was not treated

- But, what are the differences between those two people? How do we know that activity participation is the only difference between them?

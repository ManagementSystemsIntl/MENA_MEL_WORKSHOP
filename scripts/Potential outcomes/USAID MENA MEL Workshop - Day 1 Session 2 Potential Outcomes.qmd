## [The Fundamental Problem]{style="color:white;"} {background-color=#002F6C}


## Measuring social benefit

We want to know the causal effect of a project on its beneficiaries

- Job training on earnings and employment

- Teacher qualifications on student outcomes

- Humanitarian assistance on food security

## Identifying a treatment assignment

Consider an indicator for a *potential* beneficiary, $D_i$

$D$ tells us whether there is an activity, or a "treatment"

The subscript $i$ denotes a single individual who is either treated or not treated

$D_i$ = 1 means participation in an activity

$D_i$ = 0 means no participation in an activity


## Identifying an outcome

Now consider an indicator for the outcome of a potential beneficiary, $Y_i$, where $i$ denotes each person or unit under study. 

$Y_i^1$ is the outcome after activity participation ($D_i=1$)

$Y_i^0$ is the outcome without the activity ($D_i=0$)

Note that $Y_1$ and $Y_0$ denote *possibilities* for the *same person*, unit i!


## Switching across treated and untreated outcomes

We use what is called a 'switching equation' to connect a treatment assignment to a realized outcome

$Y_i=D_iY_i^1+(1-D_i)Y_i^0$ 

(Plug in $D_i=1$ and $D_i=0$ and see what you end up with)

## Switching across treated and untreated outcomes

We can also write this same equation this way: 

$Y_i=Y_i^0+(Y_i^1-Y_i^0)D_i$

This equation makes it easier to notice our treatment effect, which is $Y_i^1-Y_i^0$, or the difference between the treated and untreated outcome

We call the difference $Y_i^1-Y_i^0$ $delta$, or $\delta_i$ 

Again notice that the treatment effect $\delta_i$ refers to the *same* individual! 


## The fundamental problem of causal inference

To recap: the effect of the activity (treatment effect) on person $i$ is the difference between the two potential outcomes

Treatment effect = $Y_i^1 - Y_i^0$, or $\delta_i$

This is the difference in potential outcomes for the *same person*

A person participates in an activity, and then goes back in time and does not participate in the activity

## The fundamental problem of causal inference

But how can one person be both treated and untreated?

In the real world, person $i$ experiences one of the potential outcomes, but not both

If $D_i=1$, the potential outcome of $Y_i$ becomes $Y_i^1$ in fact and the potential outcome of $Y_i^0$ is unobserved

If $D_i=0$, the potential outcome of $Y_i$ becomes $Y_i^0$ in fact and the potential outcome of $Y_i^1$ is unobserved

## The fundamental problem of causal inference

This is the fundamental problem of causal inference:

We observe only one outcome, but we need both outcomes to describe the effect of the project

We refer to the outcome that didn't happen as the *counterfactual*, or what would have happened in the absence of the project

## The fundamental problem of causal inference

- Researchers sometimes refer to impact evaluation as a "missing data problem"
- We are missing two pieces of information about what happens with or without the treatment

```{r}
Group <- c("Treatment","Control")
Yi1 <- c("Observed", "Counterfactual")
Yi0 <- c("Counterfactual","Observed")

t1 <- cbind(Group, Yi1, Yi0) %>%
  as.data.frame()

flextable(t1)
```

## The fundamental problem of causal inference - ii

How do we estimate the effect of a project, if we cannot observe the same person go through both potential outcomes?

We must compare a person who was treated with a person who was not treated

But, what are the differences between those two people? How do we know that project participation is the only difference between them?

## Randomization solves the selection problem

If we are able to randomize from the pool of eligible participants, we have a theoretical basis for comparing these two groups

Under randomization, $Y_i^1=Y_i^0$ (theoretically!)

So all we have to do is take the difference in means as the treatment effect

But note that we have shifted from examining individual treatment effects to an overall treatment effect in our study population! 

## Comparing different groups

If you cannot randomize treatment and control groups, there are two common sources of differences between groups that you must worry about

- The groups could be different at the start of the program (baseline bias)

- The groups might be affected differently by the project (differential effect bias)

## Comparing different groups

In development programs, it is difficult to randomize treatment and control groups

So the researcher must always think about how treated and untreated groups might be different

Most evaluation designs are motivated by the difficulty of not having randomization

## Comparing different groups - example

```{r}

Group <- c("Treatment","Comparison", "Treatment-Comparison")
Baseline <- c(6, 4, 2)
Endline <- c(10,7, 3)

ex <- data.frame(Group, Baseline, Endline) %>%
  mutate(diff=Endline-Baseline)

flextable(ex) %>%
  set_header_labels(diff="Endline-Baseline") %>%
  autofit()

```

- Baseline bias: 6 - 2 = 2

Might the difference at baseline contribute to a difference in how the comparison group would respond to the treatment, if they participated in the activity? 

## Assessing group differences

Is there a way to test whether group differences threaten the validity of the estimate?

## Inferential design across municipalities

-   For institutional indicators and public pereptions at the population level, compare treatment municipalities with comparison municipalities over time

<p align="center">

<img src="d-i-d 3.jpg"/>

</p>

This design is called "difference-in-differences (d-i-d)"

-   Why? What are the assumptions? What are the validity threats?

## Inferential design within municipalities

-   For public perceptions at the activity level, compare direct beneficiaries with indirect beneficiaries within municipalities

<p align="center">

<img src="Spillover group specification2.jpg"/>

</p>

This design may be described as a d-i-d with spillover group

Under this design, indicators can be examined both across and within municipalities to learn about the effect of CITIES

-   How? Under what conditions / assumptions?

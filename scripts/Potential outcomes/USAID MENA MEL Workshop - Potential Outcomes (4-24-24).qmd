## Welcome!

-   Who we are
-   What we do
-   How we hope to help you

## Objectives of impact evaluation sessions

-   Understand the need for impact estimation of USAID activities
-   Understand how impact estimation fits into the Agency performance management framework
-   Gain practical knowledge about impact evaluation to help USAID staff better manage and support IEs

## Benchmarks for success

By the end of this session, participants will be able to:

-   Explain the fundamental problem of causal inference
-   Explain how impact estimation can be seen as a problem of missing data
-   Speculate as to whether causal inference is a two-body problem or a three-body problem
-   Relive unpleasant childhood memories of having to learn algebra

## [The Fundamental Problem]{style="color:white;"} {background-color="#002F6C"}

## Measuring social benefit

We want to know the causal effect of a project on its beneficiaries

-   Job training on earnings and employment

-   Teacher qualifications on student outcomes

-   Humanitarian assistance on food security

## Identifying a treatment assignment

Consider an indicator for a *potential* beneficiary, $D_i$

$D$ tells us whether there is an activity, or a "treatment"

The subscript $i$ denotes a single individual who is either treated or not treated

$D_i$ = 1 means participation in an activity

$D_i$ = 0 means no participation in an activity

## Identifying an outcome

Now consider an indicator for the outcome of a potential beneficiary, $Y_i$, where $i$ denotes each person or unit under study.

$Y_i^1$ is the outcome after activity participation ($D_i=1$)

$Y_i^0$ is the outcome without the activity ($D_i=0$)

Note that $Y_1$ and $Y_0$ denote *possibilities* for the *same person*, unit i!

## Switching across treated and untreated outcomes

We use what is called a 'switching equation' to connect a treatment assignment to a realized outcome

$Y_i=D_iY_i^1+(1-D_i)Y_i^0$

(Plug in $D_i=1$ and $D_i=0$ and see what you end up with)

## Switching across treated and untreated outcomes

We can also write this same equation this way:

$Y_i=Y_i^0+(Y_i^1-Y_i^0)D_i$

This equation makes it easier to notice our treatment effect, which is $Y_i^1-Y_i^0$, or the difference between the treated and untreated outcome

We call the difference $Y_i^1-Y_i^0$ $delta$, or $\delta_i$

Again notice that the treatment effect $\delta_i$ refers to the *same* individual!

## What a conundrum

To recap: the effect of the activity (treatment effect) on person $i$ is the difference between the two potential outcomes

Treatment effect = $Y_i^1 - Y_i^0$, or $\delta_i$

This is the difference in potential outcomes for the *same person*

A person participates in an activity, and then goes back in time and does not participate in the activity

## You ask the impossible

But how can one person be both treated and untreated?

In the real world, person $i$ experiences one of the potential outcomes, but not both

If $D_i=1$, the potential outcome of $Y_i$ becomes $Y_i^1$ in fact and the potential outcome of $Y_i^0$ is unobserved

If $D_i=0$, the potential outcome of $Y_i$ becomes $Y_i^0$ in fact and the potential outcome of $Y_i^1$ is unobserved

## The fundamental problem of causal inference

This is the fundamental problem of causal inference:

We observe only one outcome, but we need both outcomes to describe the effect of the project

We refer to the outcome that didn't happen as the *counterfactual*, or what would have happened in the absence of the project

## [The Missing Data Problem]{style="color:white;"} {background-color="#002F6C"}

## Something is missing

```{r}
Group <- c("Treatment","Control")
Yi1 <- c("Observed", "Counterfactual")
Yi0 <- c("Counterfactual","Observed")

t1 <- cbind(Group, Yi1, Yi0) %>%
  as.data.frame()

flextable(t1)
```

-   Researchers sometimes refer to impact evaluation as a "missing data problem"
-   We are missing two pieces of information about what happens with or without the treatment

## What do we do now?

How do we estimate the effect of a project, if we cannot observe the same person go through both potential outcomes?

We must compare a person who was treated with a person who was not treated

But, what are the differences between those two people? How do we know that project participation is the only difference between them?

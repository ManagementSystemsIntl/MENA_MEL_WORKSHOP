### Session Objectives

-   Understand the basic setup of quasi-experimental difference-in-differences

-   Understand how d-i-d generalizes to multiple time periods and groups, and how complications can arise 

-   Recognize adjustments to handle additional complexity

-   Appreciate that generating defensible quasi-experimental impact estimates is difficult

### How Do We Do Difference-in-differences?

-   Under randomized d-i-d, the pre-treatment measurement is used to improve precision

-   Under quasi-experimental d-i-d, we depend on the pre-treatment trend to remove time-invariant sources of bias

-   For this to work, we must demonstrate or convincingly argue for parallel pre-treatment trends

-   If we justify parallel trends, we can use the break in trends after treatment to estimate the treatment effect

### Quasi-experimental d-i-d

$y_{it}=\beta_0+\delta_{0,t}Post_t+\beta_{1,i}Treat_i+\delta_{1,it}Post_t\times Treat_i+\epsilon_{it}$
$y_{it}=10 + 2\times Post_t + 2\times Treat_i + 4\times{Post_t\times Treat_i} + \epsilon_{it}$

```{r}
include_graphics("diff-in-diff with values.png")
```

### The Estimating Equation

$y_{it}=\beta_0+\delta_{0,t}Post_t+\beta_{1,i}Treat_i+\delta_{1,it}Post_t\times Treat_i+\epsilon_{it}$

where..

$\beta_0$ is the comparison group at baseline

$\delta_0$ is the change in comparison group from baseline to endline

$\beta_1$ is the baseline difference between the treatment and comparison

$\delta_1$ is the treatment effect, the interaction of treatment and time

### Plugging Values into the Equation

$y_{it}=\beta_0+\delta_{0,t}Post_t+\beta_{1,i}Treat_i+\delta_{1,it}Post_t\times Treat_i+\epsilon_{it}$

$y_{it}=10 + 2\times Post_t + 2\times Treat_i + 4\times{Post_t\times Treat_i} + \epsilon_{it}$

| Group | Baseline | Endline | Difference |
|:-----------------:|:---------------:|:---------------:|:-----------------:|
| Comparison | 10 | 12 | 2 |
|  | $\beta_0$ | $\beta_0+\delta_0$ | $\delta_0$ |
| Treatment | 12 | 18 | 6 |
|  | $\beta_0+\beta_1$ | $\beta_0+\delta_0+\beta_1+\delta_1$ | $\delta_0+\delta_1$ |
| Difference | 2 | 6 | 4 |
|  | $\beta_1$ | $\beta_1 + \delta_1$ | $\delta_1$ |

### Generalizing d-i-d to Many Periods/Groups

When we generalize to multiple time periods and/or groups, we have the two-way fixed effect (TWFE) estimator

$y_{gt}=\alpha_g+\alpha_t+\beta^{DD}_{gt}+\epsilon_{gt}$

where..

$\alpha_g$ are group fixed effects

$\alpha_t$ are time fixed effects

$B^{DD}_{gt}$ indicates whether group *g* in period *t* is treated

### But What is $\beta^{DD}_{gt}$ Actually Telling Us?

-   For the canonical 2x2, we know exactly what we are estimating

-   For *g* groups and *t* time periods, we are getting some average of multiple 2x2s

-   But how does this work, exactly?

### Two Treatment Groups, Early and Late

Let's take a single step from two time periods to three, where treatment can be adopted at either t = 2 or t = 3

```{r, echo=F, fig.height=3, fig.width=5}
#include_graphics("../viz/Goodman Bacon/g-b fig 1 treatment timing.png")

include_graphics("Baker three timings replication.png")
```

### Not a Problem

```{r echo=F}
include_graphics("Baker panel a replication.png")
```

### Not a Problem

```{r, echo=F}
include_graphics("Baker panel b replication.png")
```

### Not a Problem

```{r, echo=F}
include_graphics("Baker panel c replication.png")
```

### COULD BE PROBLEM!

```{r, echo=F}
include_graphics("Baker panel d replication.png")
```

### Where Does This Leave Us?

-   TWFE treats some data that is under treatment status as comparison!
-   Not an issue under constant treatment effect
    -   Stable unit treatment value (SUTVA)
    -   No variation in treatment effect for any reason

### TWFE Fails

But TWFE fails under the following conditions:

-   Different treatment groups have different treatment effects
-   Treatment effects are dynamic over post-treatment periods
-   Heterogeneous treatment effects across sub-groups within a treated group

### Definitely a Problem

What is the solution?

```{r, echo=F}
include_graphics("dynamic treatment effects biases TWFE.png")
```

### New Estimators, Old Evaluation

- Measuring Impact of Stabilization Initiatives (MISTI)

- Can community-driven development activities build local government legitimacy in a conflict-affected environment?

### MISTI Background

-   Village panel survey in five waves, Sep 2012 - Nov 2014
-   \~5,000 villages surveyed across 130 districts and 23 provinces
-   \~ 30,000 household interviews per wave
-   860 treated villages at any wave (17%)
-   355 villages surveyed in all five waves
-   85 villages treated (24%)

### MISTI Treatment Areas

```{r echo=F}
include_graphics("MISTI map.jpg")
```

### MISTI Treatment Timings

| Wave | Comparison<br>Villages | Treated<br>Villages | Cumulative<br>Treated |
|------|------------------------|---------------------|-----------------------|
| 1    | 355                    | 0                   | 0                     |
| 2    | 341                    | 14                  | 14                    |
| 3    | 322                    | 19                  | 33                    |
| 4    | 302                    | 20                  | 53                    |
| 5    | 270                    | 32                  | 85                    |

### Before Estimation, Matching

Doubly-robust estimation 

- Match on all variables that predict treatment and outcome
- Coursened Exact Matching

```{r}
include_graphics("MISTI matching.png")
```
### Single-wave Analysis

Final reporting of MISTI relied on a series of single-wave estimations

| Measure   | Wave 2-4 | Wave 2-5 | Wave 3-4 | Wave 4-5 | Wave 3-5 |
|-----------|----------|----------|----------|----------|----------|
| Stability | .031     | .043     | .003     | -.039    | -.002    |

### MISTI Two Way Fixed Effects (TWFE)

$y_{it}=\alpha_i+\alpha_t+\beta^{DD}_{it}+\epsilon_{it}$

$y_{it}=village_i+wave_t+treated^{DD}_{it}+\epsilon_{it}$


| Term      | Estimate | Standard<br>Error | t statistic | p value |
|-----------|----------|-------------------|---------------|-----------|
| Treatment | -.0389    | .0947             | -.411         | .681      |

### Diagnostic: the Bacon Decomposition

-   The Bacon decomposition will take a TWFE model and decompose it into the full array of 2x2 d-i-d cells used to construct the overall estimate
-   The decomposition will also calculate the variance-weights used in regression to see which 2x2 cells are powering the overall estimate
-   After diagnosing a problem, the researcher can correct for the bias by using the newer estimators

```{r include=F}

mistibacon <- bacon(stab_std ~ treat_event,
                    data=mistifull,
                    id_var="village",
                    time_var="wave") 

```

### MISTI bacondecomp 2x2 Cells

```{r echo=F}

mistibacon %>%
  gt() %>%
  opt_table_font(font="Gill Sans Mt",
                 size=16) %>%
  cols_align(align="center") 
```

### Plot of 2x2 Cells

```{r echo=F, fig.height=4, fig.width=6}

#ot <- data.frame(mistibacon)

ggplot(mistibacon) +
  aes(x = weight, y = estimate, shape = factor(type), color=as.factor(type)) +
  labs(x = "Weight", y = "Estimate", shape = "Type", color="Type") +
  geom_point() + 
  scale_x_continuous(limits=c(0,.3),
                     breaks=seq(0,.3,.05)) +
  scale_color_viridis_d() + 
  faceted + 
  theme(legend.title=element_blank())
```

### MISTI bacondecomp

```{r}

ot <- bacon(stab_std ~ treat_event,
                    data=mistifull,
                    id_var="village",
                    time_var="wave") 

```

```{r}
mistibacon_coef <- sum(mistibacon$estimate * mistibacon$weight)

mistibacon_coef 

```

If the Bacon Decomposition reveals a problem, use the newer estimators

### Callaway and Sant'Anna (2021)

This estimation gives you multiple outcomes

-   Estimates for each treated group at each treated period
-   Dynamic treatment effects for each treated group
-   Aggregate treatment effect for each treatment group
-   Overall treatment effect across all groups and periods, after discarding biased 2x2 cells

### What Have We Learned About MISTI?

-   Using the newer econometric estimators, we were able to show dynamic treatment effects across time
-   These dynamic effects highlighted initial success of the 2010 surge
-   Early success gradually declined until the legitimacy crisis of the 2014 election

### What Have We Learned About Evaluation?

-   In certain settings, two-way fixed effects estimation is biased in ways that we only recently came to realize
-   We have to carefully think through the data generating process (logic modeling) for each individual setting
-   As we get more granular data and ask deeper questions, econometric tools are starting to provide better insight into treatment dynamics

### What Should We Do?

-   For any two-way fixed effects setting, use the Bacon decomposition to diagnose any problems
-   Use event study designs to examine dynamic treatment effects
-   Re-examine old evaluations!!

### Looking Ahead

Stay tuned for sessions on:  

- Logic modeling
- Learning agendas
- Mapping

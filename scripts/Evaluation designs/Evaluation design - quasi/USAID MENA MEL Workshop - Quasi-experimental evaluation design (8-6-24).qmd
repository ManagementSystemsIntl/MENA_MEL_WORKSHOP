### Welcome!

-   Who we are
-   What we do
-   How we hope to help you

### Objectives of impact evaluation sessions

-   Understand the need for impact estimation of USAID activities
-   Understand how impact estimation fits into the Agency performance management framework
-   Gain practical knowledge about impact evaluation to help USAID staff better manage and support IEs

### Benchmarks for success

By the end of this session, participants will be able to:

-   Understand selection bias as a fundamental difficulty in identifying a valid counterfactual

-   Identify strategies for generating 'as-if' randomization

-   Understand the relative strengths and weaknesses of different designs

### Benchmarks for success

*Bonus content:*

- Machine learning  

- Causal AI

### Measuring social benefit

We want to know the causal effect of an activity on its beneficiaries

-   Job training on earnings and employment

-   Teacher qualifications on student outcomes

-   Humanitarian assistance on food security

### Identifying a treatment assignment

-   We established indicators for treatment assignment $D_i$ and an outcome of interest $Y_i$

-   We established the switching equation $Y_i=D_iY_i^1+(1-D_i)Y_i^0$ mapping a potential treatment assignment to a realized outcome

-   We re-wrote the switching equation to $Y_i=Y_i^0+(Y_i^1-Y_i^0)D_i$ in order to highlight the individual treatment effect term $\delta_i=Y_i^1-Y_i^0$

### The treatment assignment mechanism

- We establish that the intervention could not be randomly assigned

- In the absence of randomization, it becomes critically important to understand the data generating process that applies the switching equation 

- With a deep knowledge of the environment we are operating in, we may be able to adopt some tactics to help with evaluation

### Approximating as-if randomization

- Adjust for confounders (statistical matching)

- Use trends over time to remove bias (difference-in-differences, interrupted time series) 

- Utilize an intervention's scoring system (regression discontinuity)

- Use features of the natural world (instrumental variables)

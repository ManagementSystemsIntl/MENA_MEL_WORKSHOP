### Welcome!

-   Who we are
-   What we do
-   How we hope to help you

### Objectives of impact evaluation sessions

-   Understand the need for impact estimation of USAID activities
-   Understand how impact estimation fits into the Agency performance management framework
-   Gain practical knowledge about impact evaluation to help USAID staff better manage and support IEs

### Benchmarks for success

By the end of this session, participants will be able to:

-   Understand selection bias as a fundamental difficulty in identifying a valid counterfactual

-   Identify randomization as the most effective means of identifying the counterfactual

-   Understand the key validity threats to Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs)

-   Identify the key points in the RCT management cycle to identify and mitigate these threats

### Benchmarks for success

*Bonus content:*

-   Randomization vs. Optimization

-   Longitudinal data

### Measuring social benefit

We want to know the causal effect of an activity on its beneficiaries

-   Job training on earnings and employment

-   Teacher qualifications on student outcomes

-   Humanitarian assistance on food security

### Identifying a treatment assignment

- We established indicators for treatment assignment $D_i$ and an outcome of interest $Y_i$

- We established the switching equation $Y_i=D_iY_i^1+(1-D_i)Y_i^0$ mapping a potential treatment assignment to a realized outcome

- We re-wrote the switching equation to $Y_i=Y_i^0+(Y_i^1-Y_i^0)D_i$ in order to highlight the individual treatment effect term $\delta_i=Y_i^1-Y_i^0$

### The treatment assignment mechanism

-   We stressed a distinction between treatment *assignment* and the treatment assignment *mechanism*

-   Why is this distinction so important?

-   Because many activities we evaluate target specific sub-samples of a broader population

    -   The poor
    -   The marginalized
    -   The conflict-affected

-   We can't just compare these participants to a randomly selected member of the population!

### Capturing the treatment assignment mechanism 

- We start with the individual treatment effect $\delta_i=Y_i^1-Y_i^0$

- We take the average of all individual treatment effects

$E\bigr[\delta\bigr]=E\bigr[Y^1-Y^0\bigr]$

- We take the difference in averages, rather than the average of the differences

$E\bigr[Y^1-Y^0\bigr]=E\bigr[Y^1\bigr]-E\bigr[Y^0\bigr]$

### Averages of effects

```{r}
avs <- read_excel("effect averages.xlsx")

avs %>%
  flextable()

```

$E\bigr[\delta\bigr]=E\bigr[Y^1-Y^0\bigr]=E\bigr[6,-2,13,-1\bigr]=4$

$E\bigr[\delta\bigr]=E\bigr[Y^1\bigr]-E\bigr[Y^0\bigr]=18-14=4$

### Difference-in-means estimator

- Finally, we incorporate the treatment assignment indicator $D_i$ and call it the *difference-in-means estimator*

$E\bigr[\delta\bigr]=E\bigr[Y^1-Y^0\bigr]$ 

$E\bigr[Y^1-Y^0\bigr]=E\bigr[Y^1\bigr]-E\bigr[Y^0\bigr]$ 

$E\bigr[Y^1\bigr]-E\bigr[Y^0\bigr]=E\bigr[Y^1|D=1\bigr]-E\bigr[Y^0|D=0\bigr]$ 

### Real world data!

```{r}

t2.2 <- read_csv("table 2.2 mod.csv",
                 show_col_types = F)

t2.2 %>%
  flextable()

```

$E\bigr[\delta\bigr]=E\bigr[Y^1-Y^0\bigr]$ 

$E\bigr[Y^1-Y^0\bigr]=E\bigr[Y^1\bigr]-E\bigr[Y^0\bigr]$ 

$E\bigr[Y^1\bigr]-E\bigr[Y^0\bigr]=E\bigr[Y^1|D=1\bigr]-E\bigr[Y^0|D=0\bigr]$

$=20-17.5=2.5$

### Decomposing the difference in means

What do we know about the treatment assignment mechanism for these groups? 

To find out, we decompose the *difference-in-means* estimator into the following: 

$E\bigr[Y^1|D=1\bigr]-E\bigr[Y^0|D=0\bigr]$

$=E\bigr[Y^1\bigr]-\bigr[Y^0\bigr]$ 

$+E\bigr[Y^0|D=1\bigr]-E\bigr[Y^0|D=0\bigr]$

$+(1-\pi)(ATT-ATU)$

### Decomposing the difference-in-means

$E\bigr[Y^1\bigr]-\bigr[Y^0\bigr]$ 
Average Treatment Effect (ATE)

$E\bigr[Y^0|D=1\bigr]-E\bigr[Y^0|D=0\bigr]$ 
Selection bias

$(1-\pi)(ATT-ATU)$ 
Heterogneous treatment effects

### Randomization solves the selection problem

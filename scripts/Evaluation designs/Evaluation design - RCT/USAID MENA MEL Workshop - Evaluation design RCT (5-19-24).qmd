### Welcome!

-   Who we are
-   What we do
-   How we hope to help you

### Objectives of impact evaluation sessions

-   Understand the need for impact estimation of USAID activities
-   Understand how impact estimation fits into the Agency performance management framework
-   Gain practical knowledge about impact evaluation to help USAID staff better manage and support IEs

### Benchmarks for success

By the end of this session, participants will be able to:

-   Understand selection bias as a fundamental difficulty in identifying a valid counterfactual

-   Identify randomization as the most effective means of identifying the counterfactual

-   Understand the key validity threats to Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs)

-   Identify the key points in the RCT management cycle to identify and mitigate these threats

### Benchmarks for success

*Bonus content:*

-   Randomization vs. Optimization

-   Longitudinal data

### Measuring social benefit

We want to know the causal effect of an activity on its beneficiaries

-   Job training on earnings and employment

-   Teacher qualifications on student outcomes

-   Humanitarian assistance on food security

### Identifying a treatment assignment

-   We established indicators for treatment assignment $D_i$ and an outcome of interest $Y_i$

-   We established the switching equation $Y_i=D_iY_i^1+(1-D_i)Y_i^0$ mapping a potential treatment assignment to a realized outcome

-   We re-wrote the switching equation to $Y_i=Y_i^0+(Y_i^1-Y_i^0)D_i$ in order to highlight the individual treatment effect term $\delta_i=Y_i^1-Y_i^0$

### The treatment assignment mechanism

-   We stressed a distinction between treatment *assignment* and the treatment assignment *mechanism*

-   Why is this distinction so important?

-   Because many activities we evaluate target specific sub-samples of a broader population

    -   The poor
    -   The marginalized
    -   The conflict-affected

-   We can't just compare these participants to a randomly selected member of the population!

### Capturing the treatment assignment mechanism

-   We start with the individual treatment effect $\delta_i=Y_i^1-Y_i^0$

-   We take the average of all individual treatment effects

$E\bigr[\delta\bigr]=E\bigr[Y^1-Y^0\bigr]$

-   We take the difference in averages, rather than the average of the differences

$E\bigr[Y^1-Y^0\bigr]=E\bigr[Y^1\bigr]-E\bigr[Y^0\bigr]$

### Averages of effects

```{r}
avs <- read_excel("effect averages.xlsx")

avs %>%
  flextable()

```

$E\bigr[\delta\bigr]=E\bigr[Y^1-Y^0\bigr]=E\bigr[6,-2,13,-1\bigr]=4$

$E\bigr[\delta\bigr]=E\bigr[Y^1\bigr]-E\bigr[Y^0\bigr]=18-14=4$

### Difference-in-means estimator

-   Finally, we incorporate the treatment assignment indicator $D_i$ and call it the *difference-in-means estimator*

$E\bigr[\delta\bigr]=E\bigr[Y^1-Y^0\bigr]$

$E\bigr[Y^1-Y^0\bigr]=E\bigr[Y^1\bigr]-E\bigr[Y^0\bigr]$

$E\bigr[Y^1\bigr]-E\bigr[Y^0\bigr]=E\bigr[Y^1|D=1\bigr]-E\bigr[Y^0|D=0\bigr]$

### Real world data!

```{r}

t2.2 <- read_csv("table 2.2 mod.csv",
                 show_col_types = F)

t2.2 %>%
  flextable()

```

$E\bigr[\delta\bigr]=E\bigr[Y^1-Y^0\bigr]$

$E\bigr[Y^1-Y^0\bigr]=E\bigr[Y^1\bigr]-E\bigr[Y^0\bigr]$

$E\bigr[Y^1\bigr]-E\bigr[Y^0\bigr]=E\bigr[Y^1|D=1\bigr]-E\bigr[Y^0|D=0\bigr]$

$=20-17.5=2.5$

### Decomposing the difference in means

What do we know about the treatment assignment mechanism for these groups?

To find out, we decompose the *difference-in-means* estimator into the following:

$E\bigr[Y^1|D=1\bigr]-E\bigr[Y^0|D=0\bigr]$

$=E\bigr[Y^1\bigr]-\bigr[Y^0\bigr]$

$+E\bigr[Y^0|D=1\bigr]-E\bigr[Y^0|D=0\bigr]$

$+(1-\pi)(ATT-ATU)$

### Decomposing the difference-in-means

$E\bigr[Y^1\bigr]-\bigr[Y^0\bigr]$ Average Treatment Effect (ATE)

$E\bigr[Y^0|D=1\bigr]-E\bigr[Y^0|D=0\bigr]$ Selection bias

$(1-\pi)(ATT-ATU)$ Heterogeneous treatment effects

Why did we just do this? 

To demonstrate that we need to know the treatment assignment mechanism in order to know how each of these terms are affected

-   Let's not talk about heterogeneous treatment effects bias just yet

### wut


Under random assignment of treatment, the simple difference-in-means design estimates the average treatment effect (it is unbiased)

We must know the treatment assignment mechanism, in order to know if our estimates are unbiased, and if not how they may be biased away from the true estimate 

### Selection bias

We are hoping to estimate the average treatment effect, but there are bias terms to worry about

Which means we need the selection bias term to be zero

The selection bias term says that the difference in the pre-treatment outcome in the treatment group $(E\bigr[Y^0|D=1])$ and the pre-treatment outcome among the control group $(E\bigr[Y^0|D=1])$ is zero 

But is it..?

### Randomization solves the selection problem

Under randomization, the answer is yes! 

If we have the opportunity to randomize the assignment of treatment, it means that any other characteristics, both observed and unobserved, will be approximately equal across the two groups!

So the selection bias term drops out (it equals zero), leaving us with only the average treatment effect

Let's test this out

### Observable characteristics under randomization


# wut 


Under random assignment of treatment, the simple difference-in-means design estimates the average treatment effect (it is unbiased)

We must know the treatment assignment mechanism, in order to know if our estimates are unbiased, and if not how they may be biased away from the true estimate 

In this example, the treatment assignment mechanism is randomization of treatment

### From difference-in-mean to difference-in-differences

The difference-in-means estimator is easy - all we have to do is compare the post-treatment outcomes

Difference-in-means is easy, but is a better design available? 

Yes - the difference-in-differences (DD) design

Under difference-in-differences design, we include a pre-treatment measurement in addition to a post-treatment measurement

### Difference-in-differences

Imagine that the outcome is a test of knowledge, and we have the opportunity to test knowledge before the intervention starts

What if the treatment effect depends on their prior level of knowledge? 

If we knew the prior level of knowledge, we can be more sure about our treatment effect estimates
  - AND we would identify heterogeneous treatment effects if they existed

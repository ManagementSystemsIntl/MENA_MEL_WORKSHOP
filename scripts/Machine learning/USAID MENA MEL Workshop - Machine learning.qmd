### Session Objectives

By the end of this session, you should be able to..

-   Understand basic concepts of machine learning

-   Recognize the distinction between supervised and unsupervised learning

-   Recognize the most common machine learning algorithms and how they are applied in development settings

### [Level Set]{style="color:white;"} {background-color="#002F6C"}

How does USAID do machine learning?

-   [Managing Machine Learning Projects in International Development](https://www.usaid.gov/sites/default/files/2022-05/Vital_Wave_USAID-AIML-FieldGuide_FINAL_VERSION_1.pdf)

-   [Making AI Work for International Development](https://www.usaid.gov/sites/default/files/2022-05/AI-ML-in-Development.pdf)

### What is Machine Learning?

-   Machine learning is a collection of algorithms that learn from data

-   Machine learning attempts to learn the data so well that it can tell you what to expect with new data you haven't seen yet

-   Machine learning algorithms can be broadly classified into unsupervised or supervised

### How Machine Learning is Different

What are the defining characteristics of machine learning?

-   Prediction vs. causation

-   Bias vs. variance

-   Over- vs. under-fitting

### Prediction vs. Causation

-   Descriptive or exploratory analysis helps us understand our data

-   Causal inference helps us understand the relationships between variables of interest

-   Machine learning tries to learn our data so well that it can predict future data!

### Bias vs. Variance

-   The causal inference tradition seeks to eliminate bias first, then looks to improve efficiency by reducing variance

-   Machine learning doesn’t care about bias

-   In fact, sometimes machine learning can actually use bias to reduce uncertainty

### Underfitting vs. Overfitting

-   Standard analysis will take the data as given, and seek to understand it

-   More advanced analysis may try to *explain* the given data

-   Machine learning algorithms are evaluated according to how well they work on data they haven’t seen yet

    -   Run algorithms on training data, evaluate performance on test data

### [Unsupervised and Supervised Learning]{style="color:white;"} {background-color="#002F6C"}

### Unsupervised Learning

-   We have a set of variables that we suspect or have reason to believe are related to each other in some way
-   Is there any hidden structure in the data that standard analysis would not find?
-   The task is to find patterns that we can then turn into new variables that capture the patterns

### Algorithms for Unsupervised Learning

-   Clustering based on similarity
    -   K-means, Latent Class Analysis, Density-Based Spatial Clustering
-   Dimension reduction
    -   Principal Component Analysis, Factor Analysis, Item Response Theory, Expectation Maximization

### Clusters in Data

::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
-   Clustering algorithms minimize variance between data points, or use a distance metric
-   Clustering is difficult when there is overlap between clusters
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
```{r}
include_graphics("overlapping and non-overlapping clusters.png")

```
:::
:::::

### Correlations in Data

-   Principal components analysis (PCA) attempts to capture as much of the total variance as possible in a single or few variables

-   Factor analysis (FA) attempts to capture common variance among a set of variables

### Total and Common Variance

```{r}
include_graphics("Total and common variance.png")
```

### Total Variance of Household Assets

```{r}

assets <- read_excel("Asset factor weights.xlsx")

assets %>%
  slice(1:10) %>%
  gt() %>%
  opt_table_font(font="Gill Sans Mt",
                 size=16) %>%
  cols_align(align="center") 

```

### Common Variance of Media Profiles

What media or other sources do you turn to for news and information?

```{r}
include_graphics("Media profile factor loadings.png")
```

### Supervised Learning

-   Now we have data that we know is related to some target variable
-   How well can we use the data to hit the target?
-   The task is now prediction/classification

### Using Features to Predict a Target

Previously we just had features. Now we have features that predict a target.

```{r fig.cap="Interested in that spiral thingy? See https://www.mathnasium.com/blog/golden-ratio-in-nature"}

include_graphics("three distributions.png")
```

### Algorithms for Supervised Learning

-   Conditional Inference Trees/Random Forests: Break data into branches for classification and regression tasks
-   Gradient Descent: Minimizes error by iterating through partial derivatives
-   Neural Networks: Identifies 'hidden layers' in complex data to conduct deep learning tasks

### Supervised learning - Conditional Inference Tree

Conditional inference trees crawl through your data, split everything into different pathways (branches), and retain the branches that capture the most variation

-   Advantage: identifies interesting sub-groups to explore further
-   Disadvantage: Overfits your data!

------------------------------------------------------------------------

```{r}
include_graphics("Iraq decision tree.png")

```

### Supervised learning - Random Forest

Random forests makes predictions using a large number of trees

```{r fig.cap = "Heterogeneous treatment effects on household income"}
include_graphics("Causal forest estimates 2.png")

```

### From Machine Learning to AGI

-   We’ve mentioned how machine learning is about the use of algorithms to learn from data

-   What happens if the algorithms learn from data, and then use that learning to improve themselves and run again?

-   Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) refers to algorithms that seem to us like thinking and reasoning human intelligences

### Learn from Your Data, Then Learn from What You Learn

```{r}
include_graphics("AI graphic.png")
```

### Welcoming Our New Machine Learning Overlords

-   Currently, the closest we have to AGI are the Large Language Models that power ChatGPT and other chatbots

-   "In the next couple of decades, we will be able to do things that would have seemed like magic to our grandparents."  
[Sam Altman, 9-23-24]

-   Stay tuned for next session on Large Language Models!

Thank you!
